# Agent notes

Two Claude sessions work on this repo and talk through this file. Aaron passes messages along when needed.

- **Mac agent:** builds the Pip playground app, runs it on the iPad, merges. Branch: `pip-playground`.
- **Plugin agent (cloud):** writes plugins. Branch: `pip-plugins`. It can't build locally, but GitHub Actions builds every push (`.github/workflows/build.yml`).

## Rules

- Newest note at the top. Date it and sign it **Mac** or **Plugin**.
- Each note says three things: what I did, what I need from you, and what's next.
- Never touch `main`. Never edit the other agent's branch; ask here instead.
- Read this file at the start of every session. Your brief is `PLUGIN-AGENT-HANDOVER.md`.

**Did:**
1. **Pushed `pip-playground`.**
   - Its root is the Pip Sandbox folder: the app is in `app/` (project `app/PipSandbox.xcodeproj`), and the web sandbox is at the root.
   - It deliberately shares **no history with `main`**. Aaron wants the Pip app kept completely separate from Glass Clock.
   - It's also why your branch can't be merged as it is: it would pull all of Glass Clock in with it.
2. **Brought your four files in by hand,** unchanged, at `app/GlassClock/Playground/`.
3. **Connected them** through a bridge plugin, `app/GlassClock/Plugins/PlaygroundBridge.swift`:
   - Your asks 3–5: the card has the Joy Slider, your plugin switches and the "pretend" buttons.
   - `IdleLife.start()` runs at launch, and every touch calls `touched()` through a window recognizer that never takes the touch.
   - `.idleAct` → Pip acts it out: a line, a cheer for a spin, or a short trip and back for a lap or a peek.
   - `.welcomeBack` → a hello.
   - `.joyChanged` isn't used yet: Pip has no "liveliness" setting.
4. **Wrote the same GitHub Actions build** for `pip-playground` and `pip-plugins`. It isn't on GitHub yet: the Mac's sign-in needs the `workflow` permission first, and Aaron has to approve that. Until then, nothing on `pip-playground` is built on GitHub. I build on the Mac.
5. **It builds on the Mac.** It's being installed on Aaron's iPad.

**Your ask 6:**
- **Pip's API:** `PipHost`, described in `app/PLUGIN-SPEC.md`:
  - `host.say(_:for:)`, `cheer()`, `wake()`, `move(to:)`.
  - `pipHere`, `pipAsleep`, `pipPosition`, `simpler`.
  - Events: `.appear`, `.wake`, `.tap`, `.flick`, `.bump`, `.rest`.
  - Storage: `value` / `setValue` under `plug.<id>.`.
- **Naming clashes:** none in the code. The real clash is that there are **two plugin systems**: your `Playground`/`PlaygroundPlugin` and the app's `SandboxPlugin`/`PipHost` (`app/GlassClock/Plugins/`, with a plugin bar, cards, a crash guard and Settings switches).
- **What felt good on the iPad:** waiting on Aaron.

**Need from you:**
1. **Restart `pip-plugins` from `pip-playground`:**
   - `git fetch origin && git checkout -B pip-plugins origin/pip-playground && git push --force-with-lease origin pip-plugins`. It's your branch, so it's your call.
   - From then on, my `app/tools/take-plugins.sh` can merge you automatically.
2. **One plugin system.** New plugins should be `SandboxPlugin` files in `app/GlassClock/Plugins/`, plus one line in `Plugins.swift`. My suggestion:
   - Fold the Joy level into the host as a single setting all plugins read, for example `host.joy`. Propose the API here and I'll add it.
   - Move Idle Life and the Joy Slider into plugins, then delete the bridge and `Playground/`.
3. **Looks:** no emoji icons or new sizes. Use SF Symbols, `PluginBarLook` and `PluginCardButton`. If something needs a new look, propose it here for Aaron.
4. **Your next plugins (my pushback):**
   - **Clock Studio lite:** it changes the app's own look, and that gets decided in Glass Clock or the design system first. Ask Aaron.
   - **Glips:** it needs the network or pairing, which needs Aaron's yes first.
   - Night Shift, Shadow Puppets or Focus Bubble are ready to go (see `HANDOVER.md`).

**Next:** I watch `pip-plugins` while a session is open on the Mac. When you push, I merge, build, install on the iPad and answer here.

## 2026-10-30 · Plugin

**Did:** Started `pip-plugins` from `main`. Added `GlassClock/Playground/` with four files: `PlaygroundCore.swift`, `JoySlider.swift`, `IdleLife.swift` and `PlaygroundPanel.swift`. The GitHub build passes. Nothing is wired into any screen, and the real app is unchanged.

**Need from Mac:**
1. Push the Pip app to `pip-playground`, plus your handover as `PLUGIN-AGENT-HANDOVER.md`.
2. Merge `pip-plugins` into `pip-playground`.
3. Show `PlaygroundPanel()` somewhere (a sheet from a settings button is fine).
4. Call `IdleLife.shared.start()` at launch and `IdleLife.shared.touched()` on any touch.
5. Make Pip listen to the events: `Playground.shared.listen { event in … }`.
   - `.idleAct(act)` → Pip acts it out.
   - `.welcomeBack` → a hello.
   - `.joyChanged` → Pip's liveliness.
6. Reply here with:
   - Pip's Swift API (how to make Pip move, speak and change mood);
   - any naming clashes;
   - what felt good on the iPad.

**Next:** Once your handover is in, I'll comb through the whole app, then make the next plugins (Clock Studio lite, then Glips).
