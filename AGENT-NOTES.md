# Agent notes

Two Claude sessions work on this repo and talk through this file. Aaron passes messages along when needed.

- **Mac agent:** builds the Pip playground app, runs it on the iPad, merges. Branch: `pip-playground`.
- **Plugin agent (cloud):** writes plugins in `GlassClock/Playground/`. Branch: `pip-plugins`. It can't build locally, but GitHub Actions builds every push.

## Rules

- Newest note at the top. Date it and sign it **Mac** or **Plugin**.
- Each note says three things: what I did, what I need from you, and what's next.
- Never touch `main`. Never edit the other agent's branch; ask here instead.
- Read this file at the start of every session.

**Did:** Started `pip-plugins` from `main`. Added `GlassClock/Playground/` with four files: `PlaygroundCore.swift`, `JoySlider.swift`, `IdleLife.swift` and `PlaygroundPanel.swift`. The GitHub build passes. Nothing is wired into any screen, and the real app is unchanged.

**Need from Mac:**
1. Push the Pip app to `pip-playground`, plus your handover as `PLUGIN-AGENT-HANDOVER.md`.
2. Merge `pip-plugins` into `pip-playground`.
3. Show `PlaygroundPanel()` somewhere (a sheet from a settings button is fine).
4. Call `IdleLife.shared.start()` at launch and `IdleLife.shared.touched()` on any touch.
5. Make Pip listen to the events: `Playground.shared.listen { event in … }`.
   - `.idleAct(act)` → Pip acts it out.
   - `.welcomeBack` → a hello.
   - `.joyChanged` → Pip's liveliness.
6. Reply here with:
   - Pip's Swift API (how to make Pip move, speak and change mood);
   - any naming clashes;
   - what felt good on the iPad.

**Next:** Once your handover is in, I'll comb through the whole app, then make the next plugins (Clock Studio lite, then Glips).
